	abstract = "We study theoretical X-ray light curves and polarization properties of accretion-powered millisecond pulsars. We assume that the radiation is produced in two antipodal spots at the neutron star surface which are associated with the magnetic poles. We compute the angle-dependent intensity and polarization produced in an electron-scattering dominated plane-parallel accretion shock in the frame of the shock. The observed flux, polarization degree and polarization angle are calculated accounting for special and general relativistic effects. The calculations also extended to the case of nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars -- X-ray bursts. In this case, we consider one spot and the radiation is assumed to be produced in the atmosphere of the infinite Thomson optical depth. The light curves and polarization profiles show a large diversity depending on the model parameters. Presented results can be used as a first step to understand the observed pulse profiles of accretion- and nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars. Future observations of the X-ray polarization will provide a valuable tool to test the geometry of the emission region and its physical characteristics.",

	abstract = "Simultaneous, precise measurements of the mass $M$ and radius $R$ of neutron stars can yield uniquely valuable information about the still uncertain properties of cold matter at several times the density of nuclear matter. One method that could be used to measure $M$ and $R$ is to analyze the energy-dependent waveforms of the X-ray flux oscillations seen during some thermonuclear bursts from some neutron stars. These oscillations are thought to be produced by X-ray emission from hotter regions on the surface of the star that are rotating at or near the spin frequency of the star. Here we explore how well $M$ and $R$ could be determined by generating, and analyzing using Bayesian techniques, synthetic energy-resolved X-ray data that we produce assuming a future space mission having 2--30 keV energy coverage and an effective area of 10 m$^2$, such as the proposed \textit{LOFT} or \textit{AXTAR} missions. We find that if the hot spot is within 10$^\circ$ of the rotation equator, both $M$ and $R$ can usually be determined with an uncertainty of about 10\% if there are $10^6$ total counts from the spot, whereas waveforms from spots within 20$^\circ$ of the rotation pole provide no useful constraints. These constraints can usually be achieved even if the burst oscillations vary with time and data from multiple bursts must be used to obtain 10$^6$ counts from the hot spot. This is therefore a promising method to constrain $M$ and $R$ tightly enough to discriminate strongly between competing models of cold, high-density matter.",

	abstract = "We present a simple method for including the oblateness of a rapidly rotating neutron star when fitting X-ray light curves. In previous work we showed that the oblateness induced by rotation at frequencies above 300 Hz produces a geometric effect which needs to be accounted for when modelling light curves to extract constraints on the neutron star's mass and radius. In our model X-rays are emitted from the surface of an oblate neutron star and propagate to the observer along geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric for a spherical neutron star. Doppler effects due to rotation are added in the same manner as in the case of a spherical neutron star. We show that this model captures the most important effects due to the neutron star's rotation. We also explain how the geometric oblateness effect can rival the Doppler effect for some emission geometries.",

	abstract = "We present raytracing computations for light emitted from the surface of a rapidly-rotating neutron star in order to construct light curves for X-ray pulsars and bursters. These calculations are for realistic models of rapidly-rotating neutron stars which take into account both the correct exterior metric and the oblate shape of the star. We find that the most important effect arising from rotation comes from the oblate shape of the rotating star. We find that approximating a rotating neutron star as a sphere introduces serious errors in fitted values of the star's radius and mass if the rotation rate is very large. However, in most cases acceptable fits to the ratio M/R can be obtained with the spherical approximation.",

	abstract = "The cooling phase of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) compactness by comparing the observed cooling tracks of bursts to accurate theoretical atmosphere model calculations. By applying the so-called cooling tail method, where the information from the whole cooling track is used, we constrain the mass, radius, and distance for three different NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1702-429, 4U 1724-307, and SAX J1810.8-260. Care is taken to only use the hard state bursts where it is thought that only the NS surface alone is emitting. We then utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to obtain a parameterized equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter from our initial mass and radius constraints. This allows us to set limits on various nuclear parameters and to constrain an empirical pressure-density relation for the dense matter. Our predicted EoS results in NS radius between 10.5-12.8 km (95\% confidence limits) for a mass of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. Due to systematic errors and uncertainty in the composition these results should be interpreted as lower limits for the radius.",

	abstract = "On the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star, the effective centrifugal force decreases the effective acceleration due to gravity (as measured in the rotating frame) at the equator while increasing the acceleration at the poles due to the centrifugal flattening of the star into an oblate spheroid. We compute the effective gravitational acceleration for relativistic rapidly rotating neutron stars and show that for a star with mass $M$, equatorial radius $R_e$, and angular velocity $\Omega$, the deviations of the effective acceleration due to gravity from the nonrotating case take on a universal form that depends only on the compactness ratio $M/R_e$, the dimensionless square of the angular velocity $\Omega^2R_e^3/GM$, and the latitude on the star's surface. This dependence is universal, in that it has very little dependence on the neutron star's equation of state. The effective gravity is expanded in the slow rotation limit to show the dependence on the effective centrifugal force, oblate shape of the star and the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field. In addition, an empirical fit and simple formula for the effective gravity is found. We find that the increase in the acceleration due to gravity at the poles is of the same order of magnitude as the decrease in the effective acceleration due to gravity at the equator for all realistic value of mass, radius and spin. For neutron stars that spin with frequencies near 600 Hz the difference between the effective gravity at the poles and the equator is about 20\%.",
