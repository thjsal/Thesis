We assume that the radiation is produced in two antipodal spots at the neutron star surface which are associated with the magnetic poles. We compute the angle-dependent intensity and polarization produced in an electron-scattering dominated plane-parallel accretion shock in the frame of the shock. The observed flux, polarization degree and polarization angle are calculated accounting for special and general relativistic effects. The calculations also extended to the case of nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars -- X-ray bursts. In this case, we consider one spot and the radiation is assumed to be produced in the atmosphere of the infinite Thomson optical depth. The light curves and polarization profiles show a large diversity depending on the model parameters. Presented results can be used as a first step to understand the observed pulse profiles of accretion- and nuclear-powered millisecond pulsars. Future observations of the X-ray polarization will provide a valuable tool to test the geometry of the emission region and its physical characteristics.",

@misc{miller,
	abstract = "Simultaneous, precise measurements of the mass $M$ and radius $R$ of neutron stars can yield uniquely valuable information about the still uncertain properties of cold matter at several times the density of nuclear matter. One method that could be used to measure $M$ and $R$ is to analyze the energy-dependent waveforms of the X-ray flux oscillations seen during some thermonuclear bursts from some neutron stars. These oscillations are thought to be produced by X-ray emission from hotter regions on the surface of the star that are rotating at or near the spin frequency of the star. Here we explore how well $M$ and $R$ could be determined by generating, and analyzing using Bayesian techniques, synthetic energy-resolved X-ray data that we produce assuming a future space mission having 2--30 keV energy coverage and an effective area of 10 m$^2$, such as the proposed \textit{LOFT} or \textit{AXTAR} missions. We find that if the hot spot is within 10$^\circ$ of the rotation equator, both $M$ and $R$ can usually be determined with an uncertainty of about 10\% if there are $10^6$ total counts from the spot, whereas waveforms from spots within 20$^\circ$ of the rotation pole provide no useful constraints. These constraints can usually be achieved even if the burst oscillations vary with time and data from multiple bursts must be used to obtain 10$^6$ counts from the hot spot. This is therefore a promising method to constrain $M$ and $R$ tightly enough to discriminate strongly between competing models of cold, high-density matter.",

In previous work we showed that the oblateness induced by rotation at frequencies above 300 Hz produces a geometric effect which needs to be accounted for when modelling light curves to extract constraints on the neutron star's mass and radius. In our model X-rays are emitted from the surface of an oblate neutron star and propagate to the observer along geodesics of the Schwarzschild metric for a spherical neutron star. Doppler effects due to rotation are added in the same manner as in the case of a spherical neutron star. We show that this model captures the most important effects due to the neutron star's rotation. We also explain how the geometric oblateness effect can rival the Doppler effect for some emission geometries.",

We find that the most important effect arising from rotation comes from the oblate shape of the rotating star.

	abstract = "The cooling phase of thermonuclear (type-I) X-ray bursts can be used to constrain the neutron star (NS) compactness by comparing the observed cooling tracks of bursts to accurate theoretical atmosphere model calculations. By applying the so-called cooling tail method, where the information from the whole cooling track is used, we constrain the mass, radius, and distance for three different NSs in low-mass X-ray binaries 4U 1702-429, 4U 1724-307, and SAX J1810.8-260. Care is taken to only use the hard state bursts where it is thought that only the NS surface alone is emitting. We then utilize a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm within a Bayesian framework to obtain a parameterized equation of state (EoS) of cold dense matter from our initial mass and radius constraints. This allows us to set limits on various nuclear parameters and to constrain an empirical pressure-density relation for the dense matter. Our predicted EoS results in NS radius between 10.5-12.8 km (95\% confidence limits) for a mass of 1.4 $M_{\odot}$. Due to systematic errors and uncertainty in the composition these results should be interpreted as lower limits for the radius.",

@misc{algendy,
	abstract = "On the surface of a rapidly rotating neutron star, the effective centrifugal force decreases the effective acceleration due to gravity (as measured in the rotating frame) at the equator while increasing the acceleration at the poles due to the centrifugal flattening of the star into an oblate spheroid. We compute the effective gravitational acceleration for relativistic rapidly rotating neutron stars and show that for a star with mass $M$, equatorial radius $R_e$, and angular velocity $\Omega$, the deviations of the effective acceleration due to gravity from the nonrotating case take on a universal form that depends only on the compactness ratio $M/R_e$, the dimensionless square of the angular velocity $\Omega^2R_e^3/GM$, and the latitude on the star's surface. This dependence is universal, in that it has very little dependence on the neutron star's equation of state. The effective gravity is expanded in the slow rotation limit to show the dependence on the effective centrifugal force, oblate shape of the star and the quadrupole moment of the gravitational field. In addition, an empirical fit and simple formula for the effective gravity is found. We find that the increase in the acceleration due to gravity at the poles is of the same order of magnitude as the decrease in the effective acceleration due to gravity at the equator for all realistic value of mass, radius and spin. For neutron stars that spin with frequencies near 600 Hz the difference between the effective gravity at the poles and the equator is about 20\%.",

The two main emission component, the black body and the Comptonized tail that are clearly identified in the time-averaged spectrum, show strong variability with the first component lagging the second one. The observed variability can be explained if the emission is produced by Comptonization in a hot slab (radiative shock) of Thomson optical depth ~0.3-1 at the neutron star surface. The emission patterns of the black body and the Comptonized radiation are different: a "knife"- and a "fan"-like, respectively. We construct a detailed model of the X-ray production accounting for the Doppler boosting, relativistic aberration and gravitational light bending in the Schwarzschild spacetime. We present also accurate analytical formulae for computations of the light curves from rapidly rotating neutron stars using formalism recently developed by Beloborodov (2002). Our model reproduces well the pulse profiles at different energies simultaneously, corresponding phase lags, as well as the time-averaged spectrum. We constrain the compact star mass to be bounded between 1.2 and 1.6 solar masses. By fitting the observed profiles, we determine the radius of the compact object to be R~11 km if M=1.6 M\_sun, while for M=1.2 M\_sun the best-fitting radius is ~6.5 km, indicating that the compact object in SAX J1808.4-3658 can be a strange star.

@article{beloborodov,
	abstract = "A photon emitted near a compact object at an angle $\alpha$ with respect to the radial direction escapes to infinity at a different angle $\psi&gt;\alpha$. This bending of light is caused by a strong gravitational field. We show that, in a Schwarzschild metric, the effect is described by $1-\cos\alpha=(1-\cos\psi)(1-r_g/R)$ where $R/r_g$ is the emission radius in Schwarzschild units. The formula is approximate and it applies at $R\geq 2r_g$ only, however at these radii it has amazing accuracy, fully sufficient in many applications. As one application we develop a new formulation for the light bending effects in pulsars. It reveals the simple character of these effects and gives their quantitative description with practically no losses of accuracy (for the typical radius of a neutron star $R=3r_g$ the error is 1\%). The visible fraction of a star surface is shown to be $S_v/4\pi R^2=[2(1-r_g/R)]^{-1}$ which is 3/4 for $R=3r_g$. The instantaneous flux of a pulsar comes from one or two antipodal polar caps that rotate in the visible zone. The pulse produced by one blackbody cap is found to be sinusoidal (light bending impacts the pulse amplitude but not its shape). When both caps are visible, the pulse shows a plateau: the variable parts of the antipodal emissions precisely cancel each other. The pulsed fraction of blackbody emission with antipodal symmetry has an upper limit $A_{max}=(R-2r_g)/(R+2r_g)$. Pulsars with $A&gt;A_{max}$ must be asymmetric.",
